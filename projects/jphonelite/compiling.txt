It is best to compile from the command prompt using ANT.  You'll need Flex SDK in your PATH to compile the flash swf component.

cd /
ant
cd /projects/jphonelite
ant jar
ant swf

I've included NetBeans project files.  There are 2 projects that need to be built in this order.
/nbproject
/projects/jphonelite/nbproject

Good luck!
